## DISCLAIMER
Do not worry! This game will not delete system32. It's a "threat" used to meme the overall sentiment of this CLI game.

## Story
The story of pp_game is simple. I've been studying for my CompTIA A+ certification. A standard for the certification is to know your ports and protocols. So- my boss at work has been quizing me on my knowledge of ports and protocols. This is a meme response to his constant quizing out of love.

## Misc
I'd love to know if you use this game to learn protocol port numbers! I might go back to this repo someday. I'd love to generate random dialogue and port details.
